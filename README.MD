# Blogging platform - frontend

Frontend application for backend that will be developed during Itera Academy course.

## How to build the frontend

Run `npm install` and then `npm build`. Output will be visible in the `target` folder. Just copy the files on any webserver.

## How to develop frontend

Run `npm install` to get the dependencies and then run `npm start`. This will start a frontend development server which will host application. You can navigate to `http://localhost:9000` to display the application. In development mode, changes are automatically refreshed in browser, so there's no need to reload each time.

Backend is hosted on express server, to run it simply run `npm run mockServer`. It's running on `http://localhost:8080`.
